# Feature Engineering

__vectorization__: converting arbitrary data into well-behaved vectors

In the real world, data rarely comes in a tidy, ``[n_samples, n_features]`` format.

With this in mind, one of the more important steps in using machine learning in practice is *feature engineering*: that is, taking whatever information you have about your problem and turning it into numbers that you can use to build your feature matrix.

- features for representing *categorical data*
- features for representing *text*
- features for representing *images*

-  *derived features* for increasing model complexity 
- *imputation* of missing data.


## Categorical Features

One common type of non-numerical data is *categorical* data.
For example, imagine you are exploring some data on housing prices, and along with numerical features like "price" and "rooms", you also have "neighborhood" information.
For example, your data might look something like this:


```python
data = [
    {'price': 850000, 'rooms': 4, 'neighborhood': 'Queen Anne'},
    {'price': 700000, 'rooms': 3, 'neighborhood': 'Fremont'},
    {'price': 650000, 'rooms': 3, 'neighborhood': 'Wallingford'},
    {'price': 600000, 'rooms': 2, 'neighborhood': 'Fremont'}
]
```


```python
{'Queen Anne': 1, 'Fremont': 2, 'Wallingford': 3};
```

To avoid making the fundamental assumption that numerical features reflect algebraic quantities, use *one-hot encoding*.

Scikit-Learn's ``DictVectorizer`` will do this:


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer
vec = DictVectorizer(sparse=False, dtype=int)
vec.fit_transform(data)
```




    array([[     0,      1,      0, 850000,      4],
           [     1,      0,      0, 700000,      3],
           [     0,      0,      1, 650000,      3],
           [     1,      0,      0, 600000,      2]], dtype=int64)



Notice that the 'neighborhood' column has been expanded into three separate columns, representing the three neighborhood labels, and that each row has a 1 in the column associated with its neighborhood.


```python
vec.get_feature_names()
```




    ['neighborhood=Fremont',
     'neighborhood=Queen Anne',
     'neighborhood=Wallingford',
     'price',
     'rooms']



There is one clear disadvantage of this approach: __if your category has many possible values, this can *greatly* increase the size of your dataset.__

However, because the encoded data __contains mostly zeros__, a __sparse https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenyyy/data_science/master/py_datasci/images/output__ can be a very efficient solution:


```python
vec = DictVectorizer(sparse=True, dtype=int)
out=vec.fit_transform(data)
out
```




    <4x5 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
    	with 12 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>




```python
print(out)
```

      (0, 1)	1
      (0, 3)	850000
      (0, 4)	4
      (1, 0)	1
      (1, 3)	700000
      (1, 4)	3
      (2, 2)	1
      (2, 3)	650000
      (2, 4)	3
      (3, 0)	1
      (3, 3)	600000
      (3, 4)	2


Other sklearn encoders:

- ``sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`` 
- ``sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher`` 

## Text Features

Another common need in feature engineering is to __convert text to a set of representative numerical values__.

For example, most automatic mining of social media data relies on some form of encoding the text as numbers.

One of the simplest methods of encoding data is by *word counts*:


```python
sample = ['problem of evil',
          'evil queen',
          'horizon problem']
```

For a vectorization of this data based on word count, we could construct a column representing the word "problem," the word "evil," the word "horizon," and so on.

using Scikit-Learn's ``CountVectorizer``:


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

vec = CountVectorizer()
X = vec.fit_transform(sample)
print(X)
```

      (0, 3)	1
      (0, 2)	1
      (0, 0)	1
      (1, 0)	1
      (1, 4)	1
      (2, 3)	1
      (2, 1)	1


The result is a sparse matrix recording the number of times each word appears; it is easier to inspect if we convert this to a ``DataFrame`` with labeled columns:


```python
import pandas as pd
# index: which sentence
# each column: whether the key of this column appear in all the sentences (indices), yes:1, no:0
pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vec.get_feature_names())
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>evil</th>
      <th>horizon</th>
      <th>of</th>
      <th>problem</th>
      <th>queen</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



There are some issues with this approach, however: the raw word counts lead to features which __put too much weight on words that appear very frequently__, and this can be sub-optimal in some classification algorithms.


One approach to fix this is known as __*term frequency-inverse document frequency* (*TFâ€“IDF*) which weights the word counts by a measure of how often they appear in the documents:__




```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vec = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vec.fit_transform(sample)
pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vec.get_feature_names())
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>evil</th>
      <th>horizon</th>
      <th>of</th>
      <th>problem</th>
      <th>queen</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>0.517856</td>
      <td>0.000000</td>
      <td>0.680919</td>
      <td>0.517856</td>
      <td>0.000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>0.605349</td>
      <td>0.000000</td>
      <td>0.000000</td>
      <td>0.000000</td>
      <td>0.795961</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>0.000000</td>
      <td>0.795961</td>
      <td>0.000000</td>
      <td>0.605349</td>
      <td>0.000000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



## Image Features

Another common need for vectorization is to suitably encode *images* for machine learning analysis.

find excellent implementations of many of the standard approaches in the [Scikit-Image project](http://scikit-image.org).

## Derived Features

Another useful type of feature is one that is mathematically derived from some input features.


For example, this data clearly cannot be well described by a straight line:


```python
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([4, 2, 1, 3, 7])
plt.scatter(x, y);
```


![png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenyyy/data_science/master/py_datasci/images/output_23_0.png)


Still, we can fit a line to the data using ``LinearRegression`` and get the optimal result:


```python
x
```




    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])




```python
x[:, np.newaxis]
```




    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3],
           [4],
           [5]])




```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
X = x[:, np.newaxis]
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
yfit = model.predict(X)
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.plot(x, yfit);
```


![png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenyyy/data_science/master/py_datasci/images/output_27_0.png)


It's clear that we need a more sophisticated model to describe the relationship between $x$ and $y$.

One approach to this is to transform the data, adding extra columns of features to drive more flexibility in the model.
For example, we can add polynomial features to the data:


```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3, include_bias=True)
X2 = poly.fit_transform(X)
print(X2)
```

    [[   1.    1.    1.    1.]
     [   1.    2.    4.    8.]
     [   1.    3.    9.   27.]
     [   1.    4.   16.   64.]
     [   1.    5.   25.  125.]]


The derived feature matrix has one column representing $x$, and a second column representing $x^2$, and a third column representing $x^3$.
Computing a linear regression on this expanded input gives a much closer fit to our data:


```python
model = LinearRegression().fit(X2, y)
yfit = model.predict(X2)
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.plot(x, yfit);
```


![png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenyyy/data_science/master/py_datasci/images/lr2.png)


__This idea of improving a model not by changing the model, but by transforming the inputs, is fundamental to many of the more powerful machine learning methods.__

More generally, this is one motivational path to the powerful set of techniques known as **kernel methods**

## Imputation of Missing Data

Another common need in feature engineering is handling of missing data.


```python
from numpy import nan
X = np.array([[ nan, 0,   3  ],
              [ 3,   7,   9  ],
              [ 3,   5,   2  ],
              [ 4,   nan, 6  ],
              [ 8,   8,   1  ]])
y = np.array([14, 16, -1,  8, -5])
```

When applying a typical machine learning model to such data, we will need to first replace such missing data with some appropriate fill value.
This is known as **imputation** of missing values, and _strategies range from simple (e.g., replacing missing values with the mean of the column) to sophisticated (e.g., using matrix completion or a robust model to handle such data)._

__For a baseline imputation approach, using the mean, median, or most frequent value__, Scikit-Learn provides the ``Imputer`` class:


```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
imp = Imputer(strategy='median')
X2 = imp.fit_transform(X)
X2
```




    array([[ 3.5,  0. ,  3. ],
           [ 3. ,  7. ,  9. ],
           [ 3. ,  5. ,  2. ],
           [ 4. ,  6. ,  6. ],
           [ 8. ,  8. ,  1. ]])



We see that in the resulting data, the two missing values have been replaced with the median of the remaining values in the column. This imputed data can then be fed directly into, for example, a ``LinearRegression`` estimator:


```python
model = LinearRegression().fit(X2, y)
model.predict(X2)
```




    array([ 13.77424796,  15.08489797,  -1.1491576 ,   9.58429559,  -5.29428391])



## Feature Pipelines
Eg:

1. Impute missing values using the mean
2. Transform features to quadratic
3. Fit a linear regression

To streamline this type of processing pipeline, Scikit-Learn provides a ``Pipeline`` object, which can be used as follows:


```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

model = make_pipeline(Imputer(strategy='mean'),
                      PolynomialFeatures(degree=2),
                      LinearRegression())
```


```python
model.fit(X, y)  
print(y)
print(model.predict(X))
```

    [14 16 -1  8 -5]
    [ 14.  16.  -1.   8.  -5.]
