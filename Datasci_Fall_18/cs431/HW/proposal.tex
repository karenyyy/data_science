    \subsection{Introducing and Comparing NoSQL Database Management
Systems}\label{introducing-and-comparing-nosql-database-management-systems}

    \subsubsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

    With the exponentially generated and accumulated data from varied
sources like mobile devices, mechanical sensors, financial transactions,
satellite imaging, the task of data managing gets much more challenging
day after day. And these collected raw data are in a wide range of
forms, most are unstructured, like images, videos, audios, etc. In the
whole data processing pipeline, starting from data integrating and
storing, it's already a quite essential part. Since the consistency,
accessibility, velocity of data inserting and retrieving might make a
huge difference to the following data manipulation tasks, especially in
fields like finance, social networks, etc. Thus making an optimal choice
of the right database for different data format, different data volume,
different business focus like whether velocity or consistency is more
important for the client's perspective.

Widely used Database Management Systems are Relational DBMS such as SQL
(MySQL, SQL Server), and NoSQL(Not Only SQL). Why the relational DBMS is
limited is that due to its strong focus on consistency and reliability
and ACID guaranteed (ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and
Durability), thus also making it difficult for scaling, which is one of
the many reasons why NoSQL is considered better than SQL. To reach a
balance between availability and consistency, NoSQL achieve more optimal
level of consistency by slightly sacrificing its availability.

NoSQL also can reduce the level of availability to achieve higher
consistency. However there are still many remaining problems which NoSQL
databases cannot solve. As a result, providers produced distinct data
model CDBMSs(Cloud Database Management System) to satisfy different
requirements, whereas each of them are present an imperfection.

By design, NoSQL databases and management systems are relation-less (or
schema-less). They are not based on a single model (e.g. relational
model of RDBMSs) and each database, depending on their
target-functionality, adopt a different one.

There are almost a handful of different operational models and
functioning systems for NoSQL databases.:

    \subsubsection{Goal}\label{goal}

    The proposed goal of the paper is to give a precise introduction of the
NoSQL DBMS and provide a comparison of some of the most frequently used
in the industries nowadays, Cassandra, HBase and MongoDB, mainly from 4
aspects: their mechanism, important features, advantages, existing
problems.

    \subsubsection{Proposing Outline}\label{proposing-outline}

    \paragraph{NoSQL Data Models}\label{nosql-data-models}

    There are four frequently used data models of NoSQL databases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Key / Value Store:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    e.g. Redis, MemcacheDB
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Column Store:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    e.g. Cassandra, HBase
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Document:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    e.g. MongoDB, Couchbase
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Graph:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    e.g. OrientDB, Neo4J, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Comparison}\label{comparison}

    From the varied industrial level used NoSQL DBMS, we mainly discuss the
following 3 and would make comprehensive comparisons among these DBMS:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cassandra
\item
  Mongodb
\item
  Hbase
\end{itemize}

on factors listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  mechanism

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Architecture
  \item
    Data Model
  \end{itemize}
\item
  features

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Partition
  \item
    Replication
  \end{itemize}
\item
  advantage
\item
  disadvantage
\end{itemize}

    \subparagraph{Cassandra (very rough example, more details will be
concluded)}\label{cassandra-very-rough-example-more-details-will-be-concluded}

    Cassandra is an open source DBMS, with a peer-to-peer distributed system
across its nodes, in this way it achieves a high availability. Its data
model si inherited from BigTable, with the keyspaces being the container
of data, in which contains column families. Row-keys are the identifiers
of columns. Cassandra could always achieve a better performance by
querying on row-keys.

As a distributed database management system, it partitions the data
across all participating nodes in the cluster. There are two
partitioning strategies in Cassandra: Random partitioning (default and
recommended) and Ordered partitioning. If partitioning is initialized,
every change made will not be processed without reloading the whole data
again.

In every transaction, Cassandra replicates data to achieve high
availability by storing replicas on multiple nodes in the cluster to
guarantee reasonable fault tolerance. So Cassandra rely on a high speed
and low latency network connection. Since it does not operate under the
master-slave replication strategy like in HBase, thus situations like
the single points failures do not exist in Cassandra, ensuring higher
level of availability. But in this case, the extra transactions incurred
between could be expensive.
